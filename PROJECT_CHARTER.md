# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Project Charter

## Team Information
**Project Manager:** Ghiya El Daouk (@ghiyascode)

**Team Size:** 6 members

**Semester:** Fall 2025

## Project Vision
**Problem Statement:** Campus cats currently roam free with no way for students to realistically find them. Our Campus Cat Tracker Web Application will solve that - a private, university-only platform that displays the real-time locations of campus cats on a Google Map, alongside detailed cat profiles.

**Target Users:** UTA students, staff, etc.

**Success Metrics:**
1. UTA students can securely log in with @mavs.uta.edu credentials.

2. The web app displays accurate, real-time cat locations on a campus map.

3. Each catâ€™s profile is viewable and correctly linked to its location marker.

4. DND privacy logic and authentication reliably protect data access.

## Technical Architecture
**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend:
  
React + Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Google Maps JavaScript API via @react-google-maps/api

Routing with React Router

- Backend:
  
Firebase Cloud Functions (HTTPS endpoint for tracker webhooks + server logic)

- Database:
  
Cloud Firestore (realtime reads for map & profiles)

Firebase Storage (cat photos)

- Deployment:
  
Vercel for the frontend (fast CI/CD)

Firebase for Cloud Functions/Firestore/Storage (managed backend)

**Key Features (MVP):**
1. Cat Profiles: Photo, name, bio, feeding prefs, dietary restrictions, where OK to give rubs/where not, DND schedule, (stretch: last seen time/location)
2. Map + Real-Time Locations: Google Map centered on campus; markers for each cat; click = cat profile popup 
3. Auth & Privacy: Email OTP restricted to @mavs.uta.edu. Enforce DND (hide location during set hours).
